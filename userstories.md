### Login and account creation (us-1)
**As a new player, I want to be able to create an account and log in so that I can see what the game is about.**

The user needs to be able to input user information, like username and password, and be able to login with these details. The details are to be saved to a database, which in first iteration will just be a csv file stored locally to the user's computer. The data should be saved for the next time the user opens the application. The user may then input the previously saved user details and these will be checked up against details saved in the database. The application should also prevent users from choosing the same usernames.
