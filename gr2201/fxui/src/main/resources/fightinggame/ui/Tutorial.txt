In NTNU Fighterz you will be pinned up against your peers in a brawl to the death!

Before trying your luck on the battlefield, you can read about the characters on the character information page. Here you will find important information about their movesets, as well as some lore behind the characters.

After choosing your preferred fighter, you can hone your skills in the singleplayer mode. Here you can try out characters and their movesets against a dummy. The controls to control your character is by default:
* W to jump, A to go left, and D to go right.
* C to attack. You can attack in different directions using the WASD keys.
* V to use special attack. The special attack varies depending on what other keys you hold:
    * Neutral special if no other key is pressed.
    * Side special if A or D is pressed.
    * Up special if W is pressed.
    * Down special if S is pressed.

After some practice you can try to play against your friends in our local multiplayer mode! For player 1 use WASD, C and V, and for player 2 use IJKL, N and M. You can also change these controls in the settings menu.

When playing against your friends, you can also unlock achievements. The achievements you have unlocked and the unlock conditions for other achievements can be found under the achievements tab.

Lastly, you can also change audio, controls and account details in the settings menu.

Good luck!
